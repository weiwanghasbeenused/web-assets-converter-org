<p>Webp Manager is a tool that helps you manage webp/webm files. While webp and webm are the format that optimizes website loading time due to their minimal size, there are still some broswers that don't support them (especially webm). In addition, there will be some trade-off in terms of quality because webp and webm are largely compressed. There might be some cases where you want to keep the original quality and not use webp/webm at all. This website is coded to try using webp/webm first, then use the original file as a fallback option. In addition, it is possible that. The images and videos have to be uploaded through <a class="prevent-word-shadow" href="open-records-generator">open-records-generator</a> first before they can be loaded by Webp Manager. Webp Manager has three functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Convert<br>You can convert the images/videos uploaded through open-records-generator here.</li>
    <li>Upload</li>
    <li>Delete</li>
</ul>
